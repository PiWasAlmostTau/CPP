# CPP
A collection of things written in C++
Most things have decent documentation if you want to understand my code and how it works.

Polygons- a little asteroids type game with basic textures and shaders that uses SFML as the rendering system.
  To play- download all the files into a folder and click the .exe, or re-compile the C++ files and make your own executable.
  You may need to set up SFML to recompile.
  
LinkedList- a pointer based ordered linked list data structure implementation, along with a formated data "API" type thing that
  reads from a text file and does the basic CRUD type operations. There's not much error checking, if I were actually going to implement
  this data structure I would improve that.
  
KnightsTour- a recursive, brute-force knight's tour solver (if you're not familiar with what a knight's tour is,
  see here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight%27s_tour). It prints out the solution to every complete tour it finds,
  and also checks for semi-magical boards (boards where the move numbers in the rows and columns add to the same values)
  
RecursionPractice- a quick assortment of simple recursive functions
